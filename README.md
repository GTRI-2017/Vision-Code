# Vision-Code for the Parrot AR Drone 1/2
This code was developed over the summer of 2017 during an internship with GTRI. The code was developed using [OpenCV 3.2](https://opencv.org/about.html) and [Ros Kinetic](http://www.ros.org/) 

Instructions on how to setup code to work with the Parrot Drone is in *ROS Squad 3 Code Setup* pdf document above  
 
 Realize that some tweaking might need to be done for code to function
